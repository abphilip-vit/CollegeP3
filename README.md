# College: Soil Moisture Prediction 
Moisture in soil gets absorbed and evaporated and their rate of evaporation will rely on several factors like atmospheric temperature and humidity. To avoid excess watering of fields, we can predict the expected soil moisture content by obtaining a relation between soil moisture and temperature, pressure.

Soil moisture is one of the main factors in agricultural production and hydrological cycles. Existing prediction models have problems such as prediction accuracy, generalization, and multi-feature processing capability, and prediction performance must improve.

Based on this, the deep learning regression network with big data fitting capability was proposed to construct a soil moisture prediction model. By integrating the dataset, analyzing the time series of the predictive variables, and clarifying the relationship between features and predictive variables through the Taylor diagram, selected meteorological parameters can provide effective weights for moisture prediction.
